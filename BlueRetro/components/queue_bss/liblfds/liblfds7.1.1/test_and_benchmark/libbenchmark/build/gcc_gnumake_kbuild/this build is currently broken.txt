Good filename, eh? :-)

The build is broken in two ways.

Firstly, the porting abstraction layer is incomplete - the high resolution
         timers are missing.

Secondly, there is a bug in the liblfds7.0.0 (7.0.0) header file, such that
          it tries to use the wrong platform.  This will be fixed in 7.0.1,
          a bug fix release.
