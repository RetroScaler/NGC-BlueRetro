benchmark    : command line veneer calling the libbenchmark API
libbenchmark : the benchmarkng code
libshared    : various shared APIs'n'stuff, everyone else depends on this
libtest      : the testing code
test         : command line veneer calling the libtest API

TO TEST : compile libshared, libtest and test.

TO BENCHMARK : compile libshared, libbenchmark and benchmark.

test and benchmark are veneers only - they give a nice command line wrapper
around libtest and libbenchmark; they have no actual real code in.  If you
want to run test or benchmark on platforms without a command line, just
compile libshared and libtest or libbenchmark, and call the test or the
benchmark API directly - they're designed to be zero work for the caller.
