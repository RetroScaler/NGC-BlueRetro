 * INTERRUPT/EXCEPTION STACK FRAME FOR A THREAD OR NESTED INTERRUPT
 *
 * A stack frame of this structure is allocated for any interrupt or exception.
 * It goes on the current stack. If the RTOS has a system stack for handling
 * interrupts, every thread stack must allow space for just one interrupt stack
 * frame, then nested interrupt stack frames go on the system stack.
 *
 * The frame includes basic registers (explicit) and "extra" registers
 * introduced by user TIE or the use of the MAC16 option in the user's Xtensa
 * config.  The frame size is minimized by omitting regs not applicable to
 * user's config.
 *
 * For Windowed ABI, this stack frame includes the interruptee's base save
 * area, another base save area to manage gcc nested functions, and a little
 * temporary space to help manage the spilling of the register windows.

 *
 * It is necessary to distinguish a solicited from an interrupt stack frame.
 * This field corresponds to XT_STK_EXIT in the interrupt stack frame and is
 * always at the same offset (0). It can be written with a code (usually 0) to
 * distinguish a solicted frame from an interrupt frame. An RTOS port may opt
 * to ignore this field if it has another way of distinguishing frames.

/*
 * CO-PROCESSOR STATE SAVE AREA FOR A THREAD
 *
 * The RTOS must provide an area per thread to save the state of co-processors
 * when that thread does not have control. Co-processors are context-switched
 * lazily (on demand) only when a new thread uses a co-processor instruction,
 * otherwise a thread retains ownership of the co-processor even when it loses
 * control of the processor. An Xtensa co-processor exception is triggered when
 * any co-processor instruction is executed by a thread that is not the owner,
 * and the context switch of that co-processor is then performed by the handler.
 * Ownership represents which thread's state is currently in the co-processor.
 *
 * Co-processors may not be used by interrupt or exception handlers. If a
 * co-processor instruction is executed by an interrupt or exception handler,
 * the co-processor exception handler will trigger a kernel panic and freeze.
 * This restriction is introduced to reduce the overhead of saving and
 * restoring  co-processor state (which can be quite large) and in particular
 * remove that overhead from interrupt handlers.
 *
 * The co-processor state save area may be in any convenient per-thread
 * location such as in the thread control block or above the thread stack area.
 * It need not be in the interrupt stack frame since interrupts don't use
 * co-processors.
 *
 * Along with the save area for each co-processor, two bitmasks with flags per
 * co-processor (laid out as in the CPENABLE reg) help manage context-switching
 * co-processors as efficiently as possible:
 *
 * XT_CPENABLE
 *
 * The contents of a non-running thread's CPENABLE register.  It represents the
 * co-processors owned (and whose state is still needed) by the thread. When a
 * thread is preempted, its CPENABLE is saved here.  When a thread solicits a
 * context-swtich, its CPENABLE is cleared - the compiler has saved the
 * (caller-saved) co-proc state if it needs to.  When a non-running thread
 * loses ownership of a CP, its bit is cleared.  When a thread runs, it's
 * XT_CPENABLE is loaded into the CPENABLE reg. Avoids co-processor exceptions
 * when no change of ownership is needed.
 *
 * XT_CPSTORED
 *
 * A bitmask with the same layout as CPENABLE, a bit per co-processor.
 * Indicates whether the state of each co-processor is saved in the state save
 * area. When a thread enters the kernel, only the state of co-procs still
 * enabled in CPENABLE is saved. When the co-processor exception handler
 * assigns ownership of a co-processor to a thread, it restores the saved state
 * only if this bit is set, and clears this bit.
 *
 * XT_CP_CS_ST
 *
 * A bitmask with the same layout as CPENABLE, a bit per co-processor.
 * Indicates whether callee-saved state is saved in the state save area.
 * Callee-saved state is saved by itself on a solicited context switch, and
 * restored when needed by the coprocessor exception handler.  Unsolicited
 * switches will cause the entire coprocessor to be saved when necessary.
 *
 * XT_CP_ASA
 *
 * Pointer to the aligned save area.  Allows it to be aligned more than the
 * overall save area (which might only be stack-aligned or TCB-aligned).
 * Especially relevant for Xtensa cores configured with a very large data path
 * that requires alignment greater than 16 bytes (ABI stack alignment).
